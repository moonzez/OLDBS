On <%= @tour.zv_date.strftime("%d.%m.%Y") %> you have received a bill over â‚¬<%= @tour.groupnumber*70 %> covering the fee for the guided tour.
When checking our receipts we noticed that, unfortunately, the money has not yet been transferred to the account of the Bavarian Memorial Foundation. We therefore kindly ask you to check if the fee has been paid and, if this is not the case, to transfer the money to the following account:
